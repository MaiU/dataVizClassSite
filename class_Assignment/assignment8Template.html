"Big Data doesn't belong to a distant dystopian future; it is a commodity and an intrinsic and iconic feature of our present," said Georgia Lupi, and an award-winning information designer (Lupi, 2017). In this article, she talks about a problematics trend of over-simplified infographics while emphasizing the value of complex but well-constructed data that tell us a story(ies).  The reason for choosing the piece World Television Translated made by Valentina D'Efilippo is that this graph is complex enough to present good amount of information in a single piece, but at the same time it is relatively easy to digest and understand. This piece was presented on Weird Magazine UK, and its audience is the readers of magazine who are interested in technology and how it brings influences on social and political environment (French, 2015).  As Lupi points out on her article, the growth of popularity in data visualization and infographics is rapid with availability of big data, which leads people to rely on cute and simple infographics that often remove some important or interesting information. This graph is a good example of complex but visually pleasing data visualization, because it does not overly simplify the information nor meaninglessly emphasize one number over the other, which gives a balanced information to the audience.
Although I think this piece is very nicely constructed, there are some limitations. One of the limitations of this piece is that this graph is not interactive as it is originally intended to be on a printed magazine. With this complexity of data, some interactivity would be interesting and helpful to make the graph easier to read. Also, the order of the "Viewing Region" section of the countries is not very effective as well, because "Other" is listed on the third from the top, which catches eyes more than "North America" or "Latin America." The reason of putting the "Other" in this place could be that the number of viewers and languages is higher than the rest of the two categories; however, this specific category "Others" does not give the most valuable and/ or meaningful information to the audience. Hence, I would reconsider how to treat the "Other" category on this graph.

I think the visualization techniques used in this piece works for this type of data, because as Kirk says "the goal of data visualization is to facilitating understanding" and the chosen graph does a good job. I also like how spatial aspects of the data is presented in a non-spatial way. In terms of political and social implication of the piece, there probably is no political implication of the piece as it does not treat a controversial or political data. However, it is uncertain if those videos and/ or TV shows are made available to multiple languages in a legal manner or not. If they are delivered in a somewhat illegal manner, this graph shows that how information and entertainment contents have might have leaked from original sources. In other words, the high-volume of Asian dramas being translated and viewed all over the world does not necessarily only show its popularity, but also points out some possible holes in their legal system to protect copy rights. It maybe just because of the data source as the data is obtained from a website "Viki" which contains a large volume of Asian TV shows. It might be interesting to show the percentage breakdown of TV shows that is in the website by the origin of the countries. Further, I don't think this piece has any agenda, but it could possibly be biased based on where the data were collected from.

Regarding the design aspect of this piece, I think the layout works well. The layout gives nice and clean impression. I also like the color choice of this piece. Though it contains various colors, the tone of the color is set nicely in a way that is not too noisy. I think the colors are used to distinguish the regional difference, but not to emphasize any specific elements of the data which makes this piece look cohesive. Instead of colors, the difference or important elements of the data is emphasized by the thickness of the lines, which makes it easier for the audience to interpret the graph. In addition, I like the font and its size of this piece as they go well with the overall theme of the graph. Having not too many words on the graph contributes to a clean-looking which increases the design elements of this piece.  Further, I think having lots of lines makes this piece slightly harder to interpret; however, it adds some complexity and esthetics to the visualization. I think there might have been a risk for a designer to have these many lines in one graph, but the symmetrical curves help to make it neat and clean. One design drawback I can think of is that the graph having a long list of languages, which might not have been the most effective way to present the data as some language like Finish or Serbian have only one line passing through. However, this probably is a conscious decision that is made by the designer of this piece. As Fernanda and Martin discuss points out in the article Design and Redesign of Data Visualization, "Design is a compromise" and there could have been hidden goals to the audience or client, and the designer thought that it is better to have a long language list to leave thin lines in the graph for the esthetics.
  <br></br>
As described, I think this visualization does a nice job in presenting a complex data in a well-constructed and elegant way.  The strengths of this piece are that it is cohesive and clean, but it retains rich information that the audience would understand once they spend a little time with the graph. It is unfortunate that this graph is static since it would be very nice to present it with some interactions. I don't think this graph needs redesigning, but if one could add interaction to reclassify the data, this piece would be significantly more interesting.
