      a map while keeping some spatial aspects and to show clusters.
      <br></br>
    My design decision is to have less words on the graph to keep the visual clean.
    I also limited the use of color to 3. The colors of bubbles are decided on k-mean cluster
    analysis. The bubble shows raw counts of the number of the buildings, and
    a large bubble means that the more buildings built during
    a given interval. What I think is interesting about this graph is that it shows
    the growth of buildings in midtown for both West and East side. However, as a general
    trend, Westside has a more North-South spread out developing pattern.
      <br></br>
    I'm not sure if this design decision is the best or not. It might be a bit abstract
    and not very intuitive. But, I put a conscious effort to make this graph readable
    without compromising too much of its design aspect.
