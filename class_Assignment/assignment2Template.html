    <p id="word">This graph shows building years (:years built) by time and by space.
    The main intentions for makin this graphic is  to show spatial data
    not on a map while keeping some spatial aspects, and to show clusters.
  <br></br>
    My design decision is to have less words on the graph to keep the visual clean.
    I also limited the use of color to 3. The color of bubbles are decided on k-mean cluster
    analysis.The bubble shows raw counts of the numberof the buildings, and
    a large bubble means that the more buildings built during
    a given interval. What I think is interesting about this graph is that it shows
    the growth of buldings in midtown for both West and East side. However, as a general
    trend, Westside has a more North-Soutth spread out developing pattern.
    <br></br>
    I'm not sure if this design decision is the best or not. I might be a bit abstruct
    and not very intuitive. But, I put a consious effort to make this graph readable and
    navigatible without compromizing too much of its desogn aspect.
